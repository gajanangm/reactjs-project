This project provides a minimal yet efficient setup to start building React applications using Vite, complete with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and basic ESLint rules.

Currently, two official Vite plugins are available for integrating React:

@vitejs/plugin-react — leverages Babel for fast refresh and JSX transformation.

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc — utilizes SWC for faster builds and refresh capabilities.

Enhancing ESLint Configuration
For production-grade applications, it is highly recommended to adopt TypeScript and enable type-aware linting rules for improved code quality and maintainability. Refer to the official TypeScript React template for guidance on integrating TypeScript and configuring typescript-eslint.
